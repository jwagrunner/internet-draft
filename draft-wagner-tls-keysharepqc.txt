        New Key Share Extension for Classic McEliece Algorithms
                  draft-wagner-tls-keysharepqc-latest

Abstract

   RFC 8446 is modified to where another key share extension is
   introduced to accomodate large public keys for post-quantum
   algorithms including Classic McEliece.  A capability is added to
   where this new key share or the normal key share is in use, depending
   on the algorithm chosen in a TLS key exchange along with its public
   key size.

1.  Introduction

   Large public key algorithms, including the code-based cryptographic
   algorithm family Classic McEliece and the Random Linear Code-based
   Encryption (RLCE) algorithm group, cannot be easily implemented in
   TLS applications due to the current key share limitations of 65535
   bytes.  Therefore, this document proposes a new key share that has a
   higher limit and can be in use for ClientHello and ServerHello
   messages.  A capability is also added to where if a large post-
   quantum algorithm is requested, the normal key extension will not be
   constructed or in use.  However, if a classical algorithm is
   requested for key exchange, a normal key share extension is
   constructed and this new key share extension will not be constructed.
   Thus enabling the use of large public key post-quantum algorithms to
   be used in TLS key exchanges, but also presenting it as an
   alternative option in place of classical algorithms.

2.  New Key Share Extension

   Based on the key share extension from RFC8446 is introduced a new key
   share extension, key_share_pqc.  This is reflected in this document
   and is represented as KeyShareEntryPQC below, based off of the
   existing KeyShareEntry from RFC8446.  However this is modified along
   with the existing KeyShareEntry structure to include case statements
   to test if key exchange algorithm chosen in a TLS connection belongs
   to either the Classic McEliece family or RLCE algorithm group, and if
   it is, then KeyShareEntryPQC is constructed and KeyShareEntry is not
   constructed.  If the opposite is true, where the key exchange
   algorithm does not belong to either group, then KeyShareEntryPQC is
   not constructed but KeyShareEntry is constructed.  Note that the
   key_exchange field is expanded in KeyShareEntryPQC to accomodate a
   large public key that is greater than 65535 bytes:

    struct {
       NamedGroup group;
       select (NameGroup.group) {
       case classicmceliece348864 | classicmceliece348864f | classicmceliece460896
       | classicmceliece460896f | classicmceliece6688128 | classicmceliece6688128f
       | classicmceliece6960119 | classicmceliece6960119f | classicmceliece8192128
       | classicmceliece8192128f
       | rlcel1 | rlcel3 | rlcel5 :
             break;
       default :
             opaque key_exchange<1..2^16-1>;
       }
    } KeyShareEntry;

    struct {
       NamedGroup group;
       select (NamedGroup.group) {
       case classicmceliece348864 | classicmceliece348864f | classicmceliece460896
       | classicmceliece460896f | classicmceliece6688128 | classicmceliece6688128f
       | classicmceliece6960119 | classicmceliece6960119f | classicmceliece8192128
       | classicmceliece8192128f
       | rlcel1 | rlcel3 | rlcel5 :
             opaque key_exchange<1..2^24-1>;
       default :
             break;
       }
    } KeyShareEntryPQC

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Summary of Changes from RFC 8446

   A new structure is introduced of KeyShareEntryPQC along with
   modifications of existing structures including KeyShareEntry,
   NamedGroup, Extension, ExtensionType, KeyShareClientHello, and
   KeyShareServerHello.  Adding a new ExtensionType of key_share_pqc
   allows for the addition of this new structure of KeyShareEntryPQC,
   which is based on the existing KeyShareEntry, but key_exchange has
   been expanded and select statements are added to both structures
   which depend on the NamedGroup.group being called in a TLS connection
   for key exchange.  This new KeyShareEntryPQC will now also appear in
   existing structures of KeyShareClientHello and KeyShareServerHello.
   Thus the extension_data is expanded in the existing Extension
   structure.

5.  Security Considerations

   Larger ClientHello messages can cause TLS connections to be dropped
   and for TLS handshakes to be broken, as evidenced by the inclusion of
   post-quantum cryptography in applications of Google Chrome 124 and
   Microsoft Edge 124, specifically the use of Kyber768 for key
   agreement.  See [GCTLS].  A possible workaround includes updating web
   servers if receiving an error with TLS/SSL if Kyber is utlized
   through Chrome or Firefox.  See [KASPPQC].

6.  IANA Considerations

   The new key share proposed in this document key_share_pqc, along with
   its value of 63, needs to be updated in the registry specified for
   TLS ExtensionType Values.  See [TLSE].  The registry for TLS
   Supported Groups will need to have the proper values assigned to the
   Classic McEliece family with the entries of 42-51 and the RLCE
   algorithm group with 52-54.  See [TLSP].
