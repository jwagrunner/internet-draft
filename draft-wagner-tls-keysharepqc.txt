        New key share extension for Classic McEliece algorithms
                  draft-wagner-tls-keysharepqc-latest

Abstract

   RFC 8446 is modified to where another key share extension is
   introduced to accomodate large public keys for post-quantum
   algorithms including Classic McEliece.  A capability is added to
   where this new key share or the normal key share is in use, depending
   on the algorithm chosen in a TLS key exchange along with its public
   key size.

1.  Introduction

   Large public key algorithms, including the code-based cryptographic
   algorithm family Classic McEliece and the Random Linear Code-based
   Encryption (RLCE) algorithm group, cannot be easily implemented in
   TLS applications due to the current key share limitations of 65535
   bytes.  Therefore, this document proposes a new key share that has a
   higher limit and can be in use for ClientHello and ServerHello
   messages.  A capability is also added to where if a large post-
   quantum algorithm is requested, the normal key extension will not be
   constructed or in use.  However, if a classical algorithm is
   requested for key exchange, a normal key share extension is
   constructed and this new key share extension will not be constructed.
   Thus enabling the use of large public key post-quantum algorithms to
   be used in TLS key exchanges, but also presenting it as an
   alternative option in place of classical algorithms.
